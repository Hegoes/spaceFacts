                    <h3>Earth’s Unique Name</h3>
                    <p>All other major planets were named after gods and mythological figures; Earth is the rare exception. Its name derives from Old English and Germanic words meaning “ground” or “soil,” reflecting humans’ practical relationship with our home. That grounded naming reveals how our species first perceived the planet — as the terrain we walked. Unlike mythic names that evoke stories, Earth’s name carries the literal humility of being the place where life grew and where humanity developed the language to call it “home.”</p>

                    <p>The Sun is a near-perfect sphere of hot plasma so vast that roughly one million Earths would fit inside it. Despite its immense bulk, the Sun is still a typical star when compared with the universe’s giants. Its mass exerts gravitational control over the entire solar system, keeping planets and smaller objects in stable orbits. Solar energy — produced by nuclear fusion in the core — drives climate, weather, and life on Earth, making the Sun the central engine of our planetary system.</p>

                    <p>Scientists estimate there are more stars in the observable universe than grains of sand on all of Earth’s beaches combined. With numbers in the billions upon billions just within our galaxy and billions of galaxies beyond, every speck of light in the sky may hide entire planetary systems. This staggering abundance reframes our sense of scale: the cosmos is not only vast but rich with potential worlds and environments, some perhaps capable of hosting life or strange physical phenomena we have yet to imagine.</p>

                    <h3>Venus’s Strange Day</h3>
                    <p>Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction from most planets. A single rotation on its axis takes about 243 Earth days while it orbits the Sun in roughly 225 Earth days, meaning a Venusian day is longer than a Venusian year. The retrograde rotation—likely caused by a colossal ancient impact or tidal interactions—makes its sunrises and sunsets behave opposite to ours. Combined with an extreme greenhouse atmosphere, Venus is a stark lesson in planetary evolution and climate extremes.</p>

                    <h3>The International Space Station (ISS) Visible to Earth</h3>
                    <p>The ISS orbits Earth at roughly 28,000 kilometers per hour, circling the planet every 90 minutes. It's large enough and reflective enough to appear as a bright, fast-moving object in the night sky visible to the naked eye. The station serves as a multi-national laboratory where astronauts conduct experiments in microgravity, test technologies for long-duration missions, and study Earth’s systems. It demonstrates global collaboration and provides vital insights for missions farther into the solar system.</p>

                    <h3>Saturn Would Float (Hypothetically)</h3>
                    <p>Saturn's average density is lower than water because of its mostly gaseous composition — hydrogen and helium dominate. In a large enough bathtub (purely hypothetical), Saturn would float. This quirky fact stems from average density, not surface composition: Saturn lacks a solid surface and its internal physics include layered gas and metallic hydrogen. The idea highlights how planets can be extraordinarily different from rocky Earth, reminding us planetary types vary widely in structure and behavior.</p>

                    <h3>Neutron Stars: The Densest Stellar Remnants</h3>
                    <p>When massive stars explode as supernovae, their cores can collapse into neutron stars — objects so dense that a teaspoonful would weigh billions of tons. Many neutron stars spin extremely rapidly, some hundreds of times per second, and emit focused radiation beams as pulsars. Their extreme gravity and magnetic fields make them natural laboratories for physics under conditions impossible to reproduce on Earth, challenging and expanding our understanding of matter at nuclear densities.</p>

                    <h3>The Moon Is Slowly Drifting Away</h3>
                    <p>Our Moon moves away from Earth at about 3.8 centimeters per year due to tidal interactions. Over very long time scales this alters Earth's rotation (lengthening days) and tidal patterns. While the change is tiny on human timescales, it’s measurable with laser reflectors left by Apollo astronauts. This slow separation highlights that celestial mechanics are dynamic and that Earth’s relationship with its satellite evolves on geological timescales.</p>

                    <p>Black holes warp spacetime so intensely that close to them time runs slower relative to distant observers — a consequence of Einstein’s general relativity. An astronaut near a massive black hole might experience hours while decades pass elsewhere. The event horizon marks the boundary beyond which no light escapes, so we see only indirect effects like accretion disks and gravitational waves. Black holes remain powerful tools for testing gravity and learning about the universe’s most extreme conditions.</p>

                    <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, rotates in under 10 hours. This rapid spin generates extreme atmospheric dynamics, including the iconic Great Red Spot — a gigantic storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries. Jupiter’s strong magnetic field and many moons make it a mini-system with complex interactions. Studying Jupiter helps scientists understand gas giant formation and the possible habitability of moons like Europa.</p>

                    <p>The Sun accounts for about 99.86% of the solar system’s mass. Its immense gravity binds planets, comets, and asteroids into their orbits. Nearly all energy driving life and weather on Earth comes from the Sun’s continuous fusion of hydrogen into helium. Understanding solar cycles, flares, and coronal mass ejections is crucial because they influence satellites, power grids, and climate. The Sun’s activity is central to both astrophysics and practical concerns for modern civilization.</p>

                    <p>The Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy are on a collision path that will culminate in roughly 4–5 billion years. While individual stellar collisions are unlikely because of enormous interstellar space, gravitational interactions will reshape orbital paths and eventually produce a larger, merged galaxy. This long-term cosmic dance illustrates that galaxies evolve through collisions and mergers, building progressively larger structures over cosmic time and altering the environment for any planetary systems they contain.</p>

                    <p>Not all planets orbit stars. Rogue planets drift through interstellar space, likely ejected from their home systems during gravitational interactions. Without a nearby star, these worlds are cold and dark on the surface, but internal heat from formation or radioactive decay could theoretically maintain subsurface oceans on some, allowing niche environments potentially suitable for exotic life. Detecting these solitary planets is difficult, but microlensing and indirect techniques continue to reveal this surprising population of wanderers.</p>

                    <p>Aboard the ISS, astronauts experience roughly 16 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hours due to their high orbital speed. Life in microgravity requires special routines for exercise, sleeping, and working, while experiments aboard study biological, physical, and technological processes in ways impossible on Earth. The ISS advances science in materials, medicine, and engineering — and prepares humanity for longer journeys, such as missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>

                    <h3>You Weigh Less on the Moon</h3>
                    <p>Because the Moon’s gravity is about one-sixth of Earth’s, objects (and people) weigh significantly less there. That’s why lunar astronauts bounded across the surface during Apollo missions. Reduced gravity affects everything from walking to how rockets launch and land. Understanding the mechanics of low-gravity environments is vital for designing habitats, suits, and vehicles for future lunar and planetary exploration, as well as for science experiments seeking to isolate gravitational effects.</p>

                    <p>Light from the Sun travels at 299,792 km/s yet still needs about eight minutes to arrive at Earth. That means the sunlight we see and feel left the Sun several minutes earlier — an important delay when studying solar events. If the Sun were to suddenly go dark, Earth would continue to receive sunlight for roughly that interval, demonstrating the finite speed of light and how astronomical observations are snapshots of the past.</p>

                    <p>Because sound requires a medium of molecules to travel through, outer space — a near vacuum — is effectively silent. That’s why astronauts use radios that transmit electromagnetic waves to communicate. Still, regions with plasma or gas can carry wave phenomena, and instruments can convert electromagnetic fluctuations into audio for study. The silent backdrop of space underscores how alien the environment is compared to Earth, where sound permeates nearly every experience.</p>

Lower gravity on Mars allowed lava to pile up into vast shield volcanoes. Its size dwarfs Earth’s mountains and preserves a long volcanic history. Studying features like Olympus Mons reveals much about planetary geology, volcanic processes under different gravity and atmospheric conditions, and Mars’ evolution over billions of years.</p>

                    <p>Uranus has an axial tilt of about 98 degrees, essentially rolling on its side compared to other planets. This unusual tilt may stem from a massive ancient collision or series of collisions. The tilt produces extreme seasonal changes, with polar regions experiencing decades of sunlight followed by decades of darkness. Uranus’s orientation challenges assumptions about planetary formation and the possible dramatic outcomes of early solar system dynamics.</p>
